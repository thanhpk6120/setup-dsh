# Memorix — Memory Tools for Active Workspaces

Use Memorix when the active workspace has Memorix tools available and prior context would materially help. For non-trivial coding work, Memory Autopilot is the default entry point before local progress notes or broad file exploration. Do not assume every workspace is configured for Memorix.

## Start with Memory Autopilot

Default first step for non-trivial coding work: call `memorix_project_context` with the user's actual task before progress files, dev-log reads, ad-hoc file reads, or git archaeology. Memorix will choose a task-lensed brief (bugfix, feature, release, onboarding, refactor, docs, test, or general). When the task is continuing prior work, the same brief also includes a bounded prior-work projection. Treat its "Start here" files as the first workspace files to inspect.

If the MCP tool is not visible yet but the client supports tool discovery or dynamic loading, search/select `memorix_project_context` first. Continuation fallback is mandatory: when the user asks to continue, resume, take over, or explain prior work and MCP cannot be called in this turn, run exactly one CLI brief with the user's real task before inspecting files, Git history, progress notes, or guessing: `memorix resume "<task>" --fallback --brief-json`. For a new task, use `memorix context "<task>" --fallback --brief-json` instead. The absence of `.memorix` or visible memory files never proves project memory is empty. Use `--json` only when a diagnostic needs the detailed legacy payload. If that one command fails, report it and proceed normally. Do not probe help, enumerate commands, chain broad searches, wait indefinitely on MCP startup, or hand-write tool-call syntax.

After a successful `memorix_project_context` result, the brief is the default retrieval boundary. Do not call more Memorix retrieval tools after a complete brief. Use `memorix_context_pack`, `memorix_search`, or `memorix_detail` only when the brief lacks a specific reference, freshness field, or fact needed for the task, or when the user explicitly asks for deeper history. In MCP, name that missing fact in `purpose` when intentionally expanding beyond the brief. Do not retrieve the same decision twice just to confirm an already-complete brief.
If the user asks for read-only work or says not to modify files, do not call `memorix_store` just to record an assessment. Store only when the user explicitly asks to preserve it.

## When to search memory

Use `memorix_graph_context` for explicit memory graph questions or broad graph overview after the autopilot brief is not enough.

Use `memorix_search` when prior workspace context would help and the Autopilot brief did not already answer the question — for example:
- The user asks about a past decision, bug, or change
- You need to understand why something was designed a certain way
- You're continuing work that started in a previous session

You do **not** need to search memory for simple, self-contained tasks (e.g., "fix this typo", "what does this function do").

If no memories exist yet, that’s fine — just proceed normally.

## When to store memory

Use `memorix_store` when you learn something a future session should not have to rediscover:

| What happened | Type |
|---|---|
| Architecture or design decision | `decision` |
| Bug found and fixed | `problem-solution` |
| Non-obvious pitfall or gotcha | `gotcha` |
| Configuration or dependency changed | `what-changed` |
| Trade-off discussed with conclusion | `trade-off` |

**Tips for good memories:**
- Use concise titles (~5-10 words)
- Include `filesModified` when relevant
- Use `topicKey` for topics that evolve over time (prevents duplicates)
- For "why" decisions, use `memorix_store_reasoning`
- For a stable fact, reusable procedure, or completed episode that merits deliberate long-term review, include `longTerm` in `memorix_store` with the appropriate kind and normally `scope: "project"`. It creates a candidate only: do not use it for routine updates, do not make project-derived evidence portable user memory, and do not assume it enters context until an operator qualifies and approves it through `memorix memory long-term`.
- A `user` + `portable` durable memory delivered in a task brief is intentionally available across projects. When it matches the task, use it as reusable background even if its origin differs; do not treat it as a current-project fact. Expand it only when needed with `memorix_detail` using its `durable:<id>` reference and a specific purpose.
- Record the user profile: the user’s role, expertise, preferences, and goals. Save these with `entityName: "user-profile"` and `visibility: "personal"` so they stay private and appear in every brief as the "who you are" context.

**Don't store:** greetings, simple file reads, trivial commands (ls, pwd, git status).

**Only store what a future session cannot re-derive.** Code structure, file contents, and Git history are live in the checkout — do not store facts already visible there. A memory earns its place by capturing the why, the context, or a conclusion the checkout alone cannot show.

**Record what worked, not only what failed.** Store validated approaches and explicit user confirmations alongside corrections. Saving only failures drifts behavior away from what the user already accepted; a clear "yes, that's right" is feedback worth keeping too.

**Recalled memory is a claim about the past.** A memory naming a specific file, function, or flag describes the past at write time — check the file exists or grep the symbol before recommending it. If the user says to ignore or not use memory, proceed as if memory were empty: do not apply, cite, compare, or mention stored content.

## When to resolve memory

Use `memorix_resolve` when a task is done or a bug is fixed. This keeps future searches focused on active work instead of surfacing completed items.

## End sessions with a summary

When a session finishes, call `memorix_session_end` with a short structured summary so the next agent can resume. Recommended sections:
- **Goal** — what this session was working on
- **Discoveries** — findings, gotchas, learnings
- **Accomplished** — completed items, plus PENDING items for the next session
- **Relevant Files** — paths and what changed
